# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Clustering on Kaggle Data Science Survey


We have analyzed data scientists’ educational background, their skills, activities and their preferences. 
Furthermore, we tried to seek logical similarities and interesting insights among data scientists’ categories using unsupervised clustering
 method ( K-means Algorithm ). We found five main types that exist in the current data science community. 
 This categorization could help companies, educational institutions and newcomers in the field of data science.
